# Master-thesis

This is the repository for the master thesis for Data Science at UvA. This project is about modelling and detecting flower smell references in text. This challenge was addressed by implementing a BERT model and training the model. 

The files in this repo are as follow:

**Python code:**
* model-thesis.ipynb = code of the final model that was used 
* Model_wordlevel.ipynb = code for the final token-level model
* EDA.ipynb = code for the exploratory data analysis 
* Data_Simulation.ipynb = code for simulating data with GPT-2
* tsv_to_csv.ipynb = code to transform data from tsv to csv 



**Data:**
* odeuropadata.csv = labelled data from Odeuropa benchmark data 
* simdata.csv = simulated data with the labels 
* sim&anno.csv = Odeuropa and simulated data combined 
* textdata.csv = documents from Odeuropa (used for EDA)
* word_level.csv = data used for the token level model
